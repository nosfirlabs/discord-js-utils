# discord-js-utils

This script uses the discord.js library to connect to Discord using a bot token. Once connected, it retrieves the specified server using the server's ID and logs the server name and uptime to the console.

To use this script, you will need to install the discord.js library by running the following command:

>npm install discord.js

You will also need to replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with your Discord bot token and YOUR_SERVER_ID_HERE with the ID of the Discord server you want to check. You can find the server ID by right-clicking on the server in the Discord client and selecting "Copy ID".

Note that this script requires that you have already set up a Discord bot and added it to your server. If you have not done this yet, you can find instructions on how to do so in the Discord Developer documentation.
